This is a big-number library for Lua. It is based on the arbitrary precision
library number.c written by Phil Nelson for GNU bc-1.06.

To install, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua.
Then run "make test".

Here is a brief explanation of the files in this package:
  config.h        avoid external names without the bc_ prefix
  number.c        arbitrary precision library
  number.h        header for number.c
  bclib.c         Lua binding for number.c
  main.c          Lua interpreter that loads bc binding (copied from Lua 4.0)
  test.lua        test code
  tm.lua          tag method interface for bc binding

This code is hereby placed in the public domain, except for number.c,
which is subject to GPL.
