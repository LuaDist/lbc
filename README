This is a big-number library for Lua 5.0. It is based on the arbitrary
precision library number.c written by Philip A. Nelson for GNU bc-1.06.

To try this Lua library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua.
Then run make. This will build lbc.so and run a simple test. If everything
is ok, install lbc.so and bc.lua in some official place. You may want to
edit bc.lua to change the default value of SOPATH (you can also set the
environment variable LUA_SOPATH at run time).

Here is a brief explanation of the files in this package:
  lbc.c           bc library based on number.c
  bc.lua          support code
  test.lua        test code
  number.c        arbitrary precision library (untouched from GNU bc-1.06)
  number.h        header for number.c (untouched from GNU bc-1.06)
  config.h        avoid external names without the bc_ prefix in number.c

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive, specially given
the metamethods set in bc.lua. To see a summary of what is exported to Lua,
do "make xx". The examples in test.lua show the library in action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain, except number.c and number.h,
which are subject to GPL.
